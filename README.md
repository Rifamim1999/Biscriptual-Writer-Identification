The second part is the classifier which identifies the writers. The code is written in Python using the TensorFlow library. The dataset used for this work is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rifatabassummim/bi-scriptual-writer-identification-dataset This dataset contains handwritten letters of 24 writers, each written three times, in both Bangla and English language. There are two folders; one contains the raw dataset and the other one contains augmented data of the raw data. 

The environment used for executing is the Kaggle platform using GPU100 accelerator.# Biscriptual-Writer-Identification
